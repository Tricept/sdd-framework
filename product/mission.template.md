## Mission

[1-2 sentence purpose: What problem does this solve? Who does it help?]

## Target Users

- **Primary**: [Main user group]
- **Secondary**: [Other stakeholders]

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Backend | [e.g., .NET 8, Node.js] | |
| Frontend | [e.g., React, Vue] | |
| Database | [e.g., PostgreSQL, SQL Server] | |
| Testing | [e.g., xUnit, Vitest] | |
| CI/CD | [e.g., GitHub Actions] | |

## Core Principles

1. **Spec-Driven Development**: All features start with a specification
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Tests written before implementation
3. **Quality First**: Follow standards in `standards/global/`
4. **Scope Control**: Out-of-scope items are NOT implemented

## Success Metrics

- [Metric 1]: [Target]
- [Metric 2]: [Target]

## Getting Started

```bash
# Setup instructions
[Stack-specific setup]

# Start developing
/sdd.start "your first feature"
```

## Development Workflow

```
/sdd.start [feature]     # Create spec (phases 1-3)
/sdd.tasks               # Generate TDD task breakdown
/sdd.implement           # TDD implementation (Red-Green-Refactor)
/sdd.validate            # Verify implementation matches spec
/sdd.complete            # Finalize and move to implemented/
```
